    <p><h2>
        Kei is a teenage girl of average height with waist-length blonde hair that is tied in a ponytail and purple eyes.
         Her school uniform consists of a light blue dress shirt below the red school blazer with rolled-up sleeves and a short white skirt. She walks in standard school shoes with light blue calf-length socks. She predominantly wears a blue ribbon around her collar. In a more casual situation, she simply wraps her school blazer around her waist and rolls up her dress shirt sleeves above the usual norm. She takes immense pride and care in having a pulchritudinous outward appearance and is known in the class to be one of the most fashionable and modish student in her class. During sports events she wears a white T-shirt, red sweat pants with a white stripe and white trainers.
