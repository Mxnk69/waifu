    <p><h2>
   Nezuko Kamado (竈門かまど 禰ね豆ず子こ Kamado Nezuko?) is the deuteragonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. She is a demon and the younger sister of Tanjiro Kamado and one of the two remaining members of the Kamado family. Formerly a human, she was attacked and transformed into a demon by Muzan Kibutsuji.

<p><h2>
Nezuko is a young girl with fair skin, visibly large, prominent fangs, a slender build, and sharp, stiletto nails with a base color of light pink and ombre fading to a red-pinkish color at the end where they point. Her hair is long, black, and wavy. It reaches just below her waist, turning a flame-orange color as it passes her elbows, and appears to be crimped into large, straight ridges, worn side-swept drastically to her left. She has soft-looking, pale pink eyes that appear a lighter color around the rims of their irises, slanted downward toward the sides of her face and framed by notably long eyelashes, the pupils of which can appear slit as she transforms. In the manga, Nezuko can sometimes be shown with more than one bow. According to Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko was known as a great beauty in their home town.
