    <p><h2>
    Nazuna Nanakusa (七ナナ草クサナズナ Nanakusa Nazuna?) is a carefree vampire from birth who was raised by Kabura Honda before attending Kōgyō High School, where she met and befriended Kyouko Mejiro. By the time she chose to live a life by her own presence, Nazuna encountered Kou Yamori, a night roaming middle schooler in Komori whose blood tasted astonishingly delicious. In an exchange for spending time with Kou every night and drinking his blood, Kou intended to fall in love with Nazuna to become a vampire himself, a topic that discomforted Nazuna.

<p><h2>
As time passed on, Nazuna's relationship with Kou grew more intimate, with her wishing to protect his life. However, when the two came into conflict with Nazuna's vengeful first friend, Kyouko, she chose to take responsibility and clash with her for the sake of the vampire race. In the climax of the fight, Nazuna refused to murder Kyouko, and after the latter's attempted suicide resulted in Kou's “half-vampire” self to emerge, the two finally reconciled. Whilst investigating Kou's new, strong, and maniacal physiology with Kyouko's aid, Kou had a fallout with Mahiru Seki, so Nazuna, along with a large number of new friends, chose to support him and travel to Hokkaido to help Kou and Mahiru make amends. Unfortunately, the events that occured on Hokkaido put a strain on Nazuna's and Kou's relationship.
